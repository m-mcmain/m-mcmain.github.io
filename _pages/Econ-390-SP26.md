## Weekly Schedule

This week-by-week schedule will be constantly updated. Some topics may take longer than scheduled (and others may take less) but **Exam and Problem Set Dates will not change.**

**Reading**: McKinney refers to the book [Python for Data Analysis (Third edition)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) by Wes McKinney and [Coding for Economists](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/) by Arthur Turrell. Both are available for free at their respective links. There is a lot more in these books than we will cover, but they are a good reference.

**File availability**: I will include a "blank" version of the notebook before lecture for you to fill out as the lecture goes on. After lecture, I will upload a "completed" version. At the top right of the page there is a link to download the notebook as an '.ipynb' file.

<!-- **Figure of the week**: A mixture of good, bad, and ugly visualizations from the "real world." Take a few minutes and study the figure. What is it supposed to communicate? Could it be improved? Does it inspire other research questions? I have included some of my own thoughts on the figures, too. If you come across an interesting visualization, send it my way! -->
