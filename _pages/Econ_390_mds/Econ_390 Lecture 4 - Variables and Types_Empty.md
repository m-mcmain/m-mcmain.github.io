# Econ 390 - Lecture 4: Variables and Types

The goal for this lecture is to learn how to create variables (focusing on Int, Float, and String) and applying various operators to them (addition, multiplication, etc...). You can find further reading in [McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-basics#scalar_types) and Turrell for [variables](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/code-basics.html#values-variables-and-types) and [operators](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/code-basics.html#operators).

## Int & Float


```python
# Let's just try the most basic type
```


```python
# How does printing Ints vs. Floats differ? How similar can variable names be?
```


```python
# Variable name with a number in it?
```


```python
# Variables equal to each other
```


```python
# How do spaces after equal signs work?
```


```python
# Printing more than just variables
```


```python
# Order of operations and Python
```


```python
# Style after the equals sign
```


```python
# Division is possible
```


```python
# Test the types
```


```python
# Explore float precision
```


```python
# Assignment and updating with ease
```

## Practice - Int and Float
1. Create a variable `years_ago_3` and set it equal to `years_ago_2` minus 1.
2. Create a variable `years_ago_4` by referencing `years_ago_3`.
3. Print all of the `years_ago_x` variables.
4. Create a variable called `age` and set it equal to your own age.
5. Create a variable called `years_until_pres` and set it equal to how many years it will be before you can be president (don't worry about citizenship concerns). Be sure to only reference variables to create this one.
6. Create a variable called `pres_year` and set it equal to the year you will be able to become president (don't worry about actual election years). Only reference variables again (which means you'll need to create a new variable - name it whatever you'd like).


```python

```

## String


```python
# Define some strings
```


```python
# Problematic Strings
```


```python
# Let's fix that
```


```python
# We can do new lines as well
```


```python
# Adding Strings?
```


```python
# Multiplying Strings??
```


```python
# Division, Multiplication, Text
```

## Practice - Strings:
1. Without running any code, which of these are strings?
    - [ ] x = "10"
    - [ ] x = 10
    - [ ] x = '10'
    - [ ] x = "My Name"
    - [ ] x = 3.5
2. Make a code cell below and put in `color = 'Our's is Blue'` and fix it so that it works.
3. In that same cell, update the BuckyBadger series of code such that it reads "Bucky Badger" when it gets printed.


```python

```


```python
# Big Strings and Adding
```


```python
# Strings as headers
```
