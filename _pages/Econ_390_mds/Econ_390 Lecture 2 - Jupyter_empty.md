# Econ 390 - Lecture 2: Jupyter Notebook

At the end of last lecture, we downloaded Anaconda Navigator, which includes Jupyter Notebook. Open up the Anaconda Navigator and begin a Jupyter Notebook.

You'll notice it brings you to a screen that looks like a file directory. I would recommend you make a folder dedicated to *just this class* as a way to keep everything together. Perhaps even having different folders for lectures and Problem Sets. You'll also notice, you can access these files through your own file explorer! So you don't need Jupyter open to copy/paste these files.

When you open a Jupyter Notebook, it should start with a cell at the top. It defaults to code, but you can change it to "Markdown" (which is what I'm using for this block) or "Raw" (which we won't really use). Code cells are going to be our bread and butter for actually writing and running code.

## Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages
Compiled Languages (e.g. C++) are coding languages where you write your code, then you "compile" the code, then you run the compiled code as a program.

Interpreted languages (e.g. Python) are coding languages where you write your code, then run the code using an interpreter.

Interpreted Languages are good because they're generally very quick to get off the ground and run, plus they're easy to transfer from one platform to another. The downside is, the entire code needs to be run everytime, an interpreter needs to be installed anywhere you want to run the code, and they can be a bit slow.

But, for the purposes of working with economic data, they work great! We don't *really* ask it to do anything crazy and we often have many different machines we work on.

## Three Ways to Run Python Code
1. Launch Python on Command Line
2. Write your code in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and run it like a script
3. Use Jupyter Notebook to write the code interactively


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```

## Practice - Jupyter
1. Open Jupyter Notebook again and create a new Notebook called "Econ390_lec2_practice". Make the first cell a Markdown Cell and write your name in it.
2. Run the cell, save the notebook, then close and shut it down.
3. Use the file browser to open up Econ390_lec2_practice and then use the file menu to make a copy of it and name the copy "Econ390_lec2_practice_v2"
4. In Econ390_lec2_practice, write down three of your favorite classes you've taken so far at UW Madison. Save the notebook and shut it down.
5. Can you see both files in the Jupyter Home?
6. Can you find the files on your laptop? Whether this is by knowing the file location or searching for it by name. (This will be important for turning in homeworks)
