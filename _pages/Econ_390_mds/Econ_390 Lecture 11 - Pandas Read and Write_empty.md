# Econ 390 - Lecture 11: Pandas Read and Write
Today we will be learning how to use Pandas to read and write data files. This follows from [McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/accessing-data) and [Turell](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/data-read-and-write.html).


## CSV Files


```python
# Read in a CSV file
```


```python
# Don't forget!
```


```python
# Now we can read it in?
```


```python
# What does it become?
```


```python
# Check out the first three
```


```python
# Check out the last 5
```


```python
# Change the index
```


```python
# Introspection
```


```python
# You aren't limited to just the current folder
```


```python
# New useful package!
```


```python
# e.g.:
```


```python
# Change the default location!
```


```python
# Read in from online
```

## Practice - CSV Files
1. Now, try to *write* the csv file somewhere onto your computer. This is useful when you do datawork and want to export it to use in another program or save to access later. Try using the `to_csv` method on `macro_data_online` with the knowledge you have of `read_csv`.


```python

```

## Excel Files


```python
# You can also read in Excel files
```


```python
# Specify what sheet you want
```


```python
# Or columns
```

## Stata Files


```python
# Stata dta files can also be read in!
```


```python
# Same with online and specifying the index
```

## Practice - Loading Data Online
1. Find a dataset from [WisDOT](https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/safety/education/crash-data/crashfacts.aspx) and download it manually and read it into Python. Let's avoid reading in any data that was calculated by them (total, average).
2. Now, try to read in the table straight from the website.
3. Are there any columns that would make sense for an index? 


```python

```
