# Econ 390 - Lecture 3: Markdown
Today we will be learning how to use Markdown. It is useful both in Jupyter Notebook but it also shows up in many other places! E.g. Github websites, notion.io, Discord

## Headings: Make this match up with [McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/preliminaries)!

1  Preliminaries

This Open Access web version of Python for Data Analysis 3rd Edition is now available as a companion to the print and digital editions.

1.1 What Is This Book About?

This book is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python.

Some might characterize much of the content of the book as "data manipulation" as opposed to "data analysis." We also use the terms wrangling or munging to refer to data manipulation.

What Kinds of Data?

When I say “data,” what am I referring to exactly?

## In-Line: Only slightly more work than Microsoft Word

## Text Block:


## Practice Markdown:
1. Make a new notebook titled "Lecture3_Practice"
    - Make the first cell say "Econ 390 - Lecture 3 Practive" as a Header
    - Under the header, make a numbered list of your classes this semester. Order them in chronological order of their first day of class.
    - Bold the course you are most excited for. Italicize the course furthest from where you live. Strikethrough the course you are most likely to fall asleep during.
    - Below that, type the equation E = mc^2 using LaTeX typeset.
2. Make a second cell that is a code cell containing `hw = "Hello World!"`, a new line, and `print(hw)`
3. Make a third cell that is a markdown cell containing the code you just ran formatted as a code block with correct syntax highlighting
4. Run all of the cells and make sure they work as expected!
