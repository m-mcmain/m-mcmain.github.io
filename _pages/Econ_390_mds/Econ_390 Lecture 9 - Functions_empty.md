# Econ 390 - Lecture 9: Functions and Packages

Today we will go over how to create and utilize your own functions and then how to install and use pre-written functions from packages. You can find relevant readings in [Turrell](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/code-basics.html#writing-functions) and [McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-builtin#functions).


```python
# You can create your own functions!
```


```python
# Test it out
```


```python
# See everything defined in your kernal
```


```python
# Introspection on user generated functions?
```


```python
# Help?
```


```python
# Make use of it
```


```python
# Testing no return
```


```python
# What is it?
```


```python
# Scope?
```


```python
# Does it exist?
```


```python
# Is it saved?
```


```python
# Define another function
```


```python
# Test it out!
```


```python
# Name of inputs?
```


```python
# Do you HAVE to use both?
```


```python
# Initializing variables
```


```python
# Testing it out again
```


```python
# Still work?
```


```python
# Checking with state
```


```python
# Changing return type
```


```python
# What does it look like now?
```


```python
# Unpacking it
```


```python
# What happens with incorrect types?
```


```python
# Manual warning
```


```python
# What happens with incorrect types?
```


```python
# Try & Except
```


```python
# Making use in a function
```


```python
# Test it out!
```

## Practice - Functions
1. Write a function called change_counting. Pass the function the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters and output the value of the coins.
2. Modify city_state_fixer_v3 to also return the length of the string of the city + state. Test it with "DETROIT" and "michigan", printing the city, state, and length of the sum.


```python

```

## Packages


```python
# Functions we might expect
```


```python
# Importing packages
```


```python
# How does it show up?
```


```python
# Importing more and renaming
```


```python
# Making use of it
```


```python
# Importing specific functions
```


```python
# Now?
```


```python
# Tiny Dip into Regular Expression
```


```python
# Test it out
```


```python
# Pandas!
```


```python
# Getting more and more stuff
```


```python
# Import everything from numpy
```


```python
# Wow!
```
