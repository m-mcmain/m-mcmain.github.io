# Econ 390: Lecture 5 - Tuples, Lists, and Dictionaries

This lecture we will go through a few more variable types. You can find the relevant reading for [McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/python-builtin#tut_data_structures) and the appropriate subsections in Turrell ([Lists and Slicing](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/code-basics.html#lists-and-slicing) & [Dictionaries](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/code-basics.html#dictionaries)).

## Tuples

A tuple is a type of variable that has a fixed length and cannot be changed once it is initialized.


```python
# Tuples use parentheses
```


```python
# Or nothing at all
```


```python
# Convert things by using tuple
```


```python
# Strings included!
```


```python
# You can assign other variables to be elements if you don't want to use index
```


```python
# You can have a tuple of tuples
```


```python
# And access them as you might expect
```


```python
# Tuples of different types are possible
```


```python
# But if one of the types are mutable, you can modify it
```


```python
# You can also concatinate by "addition"
```


```python
# Multiplication works as expected
```


```python
# Count is handy for learning how many times something shows up in a Tuple
```

## Lists

Lists are similar to Tuples in some ways (e.g. nesting, different variable types), however they are very different in the sense that they can be easily changed.


```python
# Lists use brackets instead of parentheses
```


```python
# And now you can change stuff that previously couldn't be!
```


```python
# You can append and delete from lists
```


```python
# If you want to print and remove an element you can use pop
```


```python
# You can also remove by name
```


```python
# You can see if your list contains an element
```


```python
# You can concatinate by addition or using extend if it's already defined
```


```python
# You can similarly create variables to be elements
```


```python
# Lists as pointers and not "variables"
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries create a conversion mechanism for one variable to another (e.g. Grades!)


```python
# You create dictionaries like this:
```


```python
# Here the letters are being converted to numbers
```


```python
# Is it the other way around?
```


```python
# We can add to the dictionary
```


```python
# We can also delete
```

## Casting

You can convert variables to many different types (extending beyond what you've seen so far), usually in a way that's expected.


```python
# String
```


```python
# Into float
```


```python
# And Int?
```


```python
# Float to Int
```
