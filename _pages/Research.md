<br/>**The Long-Run Effects of Parental Wealth Shocks on Children** (with Adrian Haws, Ian Fillmore, and Joseph Price) [[pdf from aeaweb.org]](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2024/program/paper/ry4ENk8e) <br/>

What are the causal effects of parental wealth on children’s outcomes? Beginning with the famous land run of 1889, initial homesteaders in Oklahoma Territory raced to claim plots of land unaware that oil lay hidden beneath their feet. We link initial homesteaders to the locations of oil discoveries and develop new methods to link them to their children in the 1940 census, which allows us to examine the impacts of parental wealth shocks on children’s wealth, income, labor supply, education, and migration. -->

<br/>**Export Capital: How Exporting Experience Enables Re-Entry** <br/>

In this paper, I provide evidence that exporting experience beyond whether you have exported last period or not can have a significant impact on your probability of re-entering the export market after being out for two, three, or even four years. I also build on a standard model of export entry/exit by adding the concept of Export Capital. Export Capital is the knowledge gained from exporting that decays at some rate as you spend more time away from the export market. This aligns much closer to the amount of re-entry seen in the data compared to the standard model.

<br/>**Reconciling Occupational Mobility in the Current Population Survey** (with Christian vom Lehn and Zachary Kroff) [[journal version]](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/718563) <br/> 
_Journal of Labor Economics_, 2020

Measuring occupational mobility from the Current Population Survey using retrospective or longitudinal methods generates substantially different outcomes, in both levels and trends. Using a generalized method of moments technique, we estimate the level of occupational mobility and the measurement error in both of these measures for 1981–2018. We estimate that occupational mobility has been trending down, particularly since 2000, consistent with retrospective measures of occupational mobility. However, estimated mobility is 2–3 percentage points or 60%–70% higher than retrospective measures. Measurement error in longitudinal measures is large and has been worsening over time. -->
