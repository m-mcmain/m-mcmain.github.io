So you don't need Jupyter open to copy/paste these files.\n",

Code cells are going to be our bread and butter for actually writing and running code."

    "Compiled Languages (e.g. C++) are coding languages where you write your code, then you \"compile\" the code, then you run the compiled code as a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages (e.g. Python) are coding languages where you write your code, then run the code using an interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted Languages are good because they're generally very quick to get off the ground and run, plus they're easy to transfer from one platform to another. The downside is, the entire code needs to be run everytime, an interpreter needs to be installed anywhere you want to run the code, and they can be a bit slow.\n",

Then you can click on Notebook to launch it (or use JupyterLab, either one will work, but I have a slight preference for Notebook). From there you should see a file directory where I would recommend navigating to a folder you like to keep course work in and add a folder for this class. In there you can create a new notebook with a Python 3 kernel and code along with me! Alternatively, you can navigate to where you downloaded this file and click on it to open it up.\n",

    "1. To run cells, you can either click on the \"Play\" button in the header or  `Control + Enter` to just run the cell or `Shift + Enter` to run the cell and advance or `Shift + Alt` to run the cell and insert a cell below no matter what\n",
    "2. You can change cells to Markdown by pressing `M` while the cell is highlight (but while you're not in it!) or to Code by pressing `Y`\n",
    "3. There is a bunch of options you can see by hovering to the top right of the cell you're in\n",
    "   - You can duplicate the cell\n",
    "   - Push it up or down in the order\n",
    "   - Add a cell above or below\n",
    "   - Delete the cell\n",
    "4. The `Run` tab at the top will give you a ton of options for running one (or many) cells.\n",
    "5. The `Kernel` tab is useful if something gets messed up in your code and you need to start over\n",
    "6. You can rename the file just by clicking on the name in the top right"
