Perhaps even having different folders for lectures and Problem Sets. You'll also notice, you can access these files through your own file explorer! So you don't need Jupyter open to copy/paste these files.\n",

Code cells are going to be our bread and butter for actually writing and running code."

    "\n",

    "Interpreted Languages are good because they're generally very quick to get off the ground and run, plus they're easy to transfer from one platform to another. The downside is, the entire code needs to be run everytime, an interpreter needs to be installed anywhere you want to run the code, and they can be a bit slow.\n",
